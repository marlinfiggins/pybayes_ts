# Bayesian Time Series modeling in Python

The goal of this package is to be able to create Bayesian time series models at scale using Python and Jax.
Eventually, this package should be usable for hierarchical regression modeling of time series with AR errors.

# TODO:
- Need to work on holiday predictors
_ Need to work on using multiple time serie
